# Columbus-Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
This site tracks the COTA bus in Columbus, Ohio as the bus moves down high street stopping at all of its designated loading spots

How to Run: Load the page and then hit the Track Movement button in the top left corner to watch as the bus moves south down High Street from Ohio State University (OSU) campus to Downtown Columbus, Ohio. Use your mouse to zoom in and out to view all stops.
